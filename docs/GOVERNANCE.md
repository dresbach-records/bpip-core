# BPIP Governance Model

## 1. Purpose of Governance

This document defines **who decides what** in the BPIP ecosystem.

Governance exists to:
- evolve protocol rules
- protect system integrity
- ensure long-term sustainability

Governance does NOT exist to:
- guarantee outcomes
- override protocol rules
- manually redistribute value

---

## 2. Governance Philosophy

BPIP governance is:
- explicit
- bounded
- accountable

The protocol enforces rules.
Governance defines rules.

---

## 3. Governance Scope

Governance MAY decide on:
- protocol version changes
- economic parameters
- contribution criteria updates
- system limits
- security policies

Governance MAY NOT:
- modify individual balances
- override ledger history
- mint participation arbitrarily
- bypass validation rules

---

## 4. Governance Bodies

---

### 4.3 Ecosystem Council (Advisory)

---

## 5. Decision Process

1. Proposal submitted
2. Technical review
3. Impact analysis
4. Versioned approval
5. Scheduled deployment

Emergency changes are limited to security issues.

---

## 6. Transparency

All governance actions must be:
- documented
- versioned
- publicly auditable

No hidden rule changes are permitted.

---

## 7. Governance Limitations

Governance cannot:
- change the past
- compensate losses
- guarantee profits
- shield against market risk

---

## 8. Governance Evolution

Governance structure may evolve, but:
- protocol rules remain enforceable
- historical decisions remain immutable

## 9. Final Governance Rule

> **Governance defines rules.  
> Protocol enforces rules.  
> No entity is above the protocol.**
