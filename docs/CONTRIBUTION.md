# BPIP Contribution Specification

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines **how contribution is recognized** and **how participation is earned** in the BPIP ecosystem.

It answers:
- what counts as contribution
- how contributions are measured
- how rewards are calculated
- what does NOT count as contribution
- how abuse is prevented

This document is **normative** and enforced by BPIP Core.

---

## 2. Fundamental Rule

> **Participation is earned through productive impact, not intention, effort, or holding.**

No contribution → no participation.  
No impact → no reward.

---

## 3. Who Can Contribute

The following entities may contribute:

- individual developers
- development teams
- service maintainers
- infrastructure operators
- system integrators

All contributors must operate under a valid **BPIP Account**.

---

## 4. What Counts as Valid Contribution

### 4.1 Code Contribution
- accepted commits
- merged pull requests
- bug fixes with verified impact
- performance improvements

Commits must be:
- reviewed
- integrated
- used by the system

---

### 4.2 Infrastructure Contribution
- hosting validated services
- maintaining uptime
- providing compute or storage
- operating protocol nodes

Contribution is measured by **availability and reliability**, not raw capacity.

---

### 4.3 Usage-Based Contribution
- productive use of AI
- building and deploying projects
- maintaining active services

Usage must:
- generate real cost
- produce real output
- be non-redundant

---

### 4.4 Ecosystem Contribution
- tooling
- integrations
- documentation improvements
- system extensions

Only contributions that **increase ecosystem capacity** are valid.

---

## 5. Contribution Scoring

Each contribution is assigned a **Contribution Score (CS)**.

Scoring considers:
- impact
- reuse
- dependency weight
- longevity
- system reliance

High-volume, low-impact actions are discounted.

---

## 6. Time Weighting and Decay

Contribution influence **decays over time**.

Rules:
- recent contributions weigh more
- inactive accounts decay gradually
- decay prevents early dominance

This ensures long-term fairness.

---

## 7. Participation Distribution

Participation Units (PU) are distributed:
- only from the Contribution Pool
- proportionally to Contribution Score
- bounded by protocol limits

Distribution occurs per epoch.

---

## 8. What Does NOT Count as Contribution

The following are explicitly excluded:

- passive holding
- self-referential actions
- artificial activity loops
- spam commits
- automated farming
- fake usage

Any attempt to game the system results in **permanent exclusion**.

---

## 9. Abuse Detection

BPIP Core enforces:
- rate limits
- pattern detection
- contribution correlation analysis
- cross-account abuse detection

Abuse invalidates:
- events
- scores
- participation units

---

## 10. No Guaranteed Outcome

Contribution does not guarantee:
- income
- appreciation
- fixed returns

It guarantees only:
- fair participation in value already generated

---

## 11. Final Contribution Rule

> **Only contribution that increases real system value is rewarded.**
